## What it is?

CatBox is little project based on this picture.

![Two cats in box which have funny equation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47028153/181148822-2add4423-d7a5-4867-a399-5a3cf55de991.png)

My motivation was to learn basics of monadic parsers, so I chose PureScript [parsec](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-parsing) with which I can build interactive game.

Model of the game can be described like:

~~~plain
Equation is either Box or Cat.
Cat is Cat.
Box is one or more Equations.
~~~

For this model I created special syntax, which can be described in extended Backusâ€“Naur form like:

~~~ebnf
equation = box | cat ;
box = "[", equation, { equation }, "]" ;
cat = "ðŸ˜¼" ;
~~~
